# Analytics of Realtime Soccer Match Sensor Data with JavaScript and WebGL – Reprocessed and Visualized for Web Browser or Command Line Consumption.

In this paper, we report on a Web application with an additional command line interface capable of providing complex analyses over high velocity soccer match sensor data that was implemented in JavaScript and the Web Graphics Library (WebGL). This application visualizes analysis results graphically in the Web browser and in parallel also streams aggregated statistics in realtime to a command line interface. The data analyzed in this paper consists of raw sensor data that was recorded during an actual soccer match using wireless sensors embedded in the ball and the players’ shoes. The thereof generated realtime analyses are twofold: on the one hand, they focus on the continuous computation of statistics such as ball possession, shots on goal, or player of the match, which is relevant to passive spectators like fans in a stadium or TV viewers at home. On the other hand, they focus on active observers of the match like team coaches or team managers that require more detailed analyses like running path visualizations, position heatmaps, etc.
